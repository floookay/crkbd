# Corne keyboard fork

The Corne keyboard is a split keyboard with 3x6 column staggered keys and 3 thumb keys,
based on [Helix](https://github.com/MakotoKurauchi/helix).
Crkbd stands for Corne Keyboard.

## Corne MX Low Profile

This fork altered the footprints of the Corne Classic to support Cherry MX Low Profile switches.  
For more information on how to build one see [here](./corne-mxlp/doc/buildguide_en.md)

### Compability

Despite the MX style stem of the switches these are not compatible with every MX style keycap. I included some more information in the build guide.

### RGB

The switches route the light of the RGB LEDs quite nicely imo: <https://imgur.com/7JVrjXo>

### PCB

I designed the footprint for the MXLP switch based on my measurements. The footprint file is included with the PCB. The switch has a tight fit.
